SteamFlow Prediction App- This app predicts the SteamFlow of a PaperRoll in PaperMill!

papermil-model-building.py needed to run first to make the model from the CSV data file. Although i have included the Random Forest regressor model here.

then app.py is the main application file to be run.

how to run the streamlit app:

go the the project folder. streamlit run app.py
